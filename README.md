Learning projects.
=================

Small projects build for learning purposes.

[Etch-A-Sketch](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Emnalyeriar/learning_projects/blob/master/the%20odin%20projects/etch-a-sketch%20pure%20javascript/index.html) - Fun project made in pure JavaScript.

[Form validation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Emnalyeriar/learning_projects/blob/master/the%20odin%20projects/form%20validation/index.html) - A form validation script made with jQuery and Bootstrap. Still in development.

[Keyboard](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Emnalyeriar/learning_projects/blob/master/keyboard/index.html) - One of my first JavaScript projects, highlight buttons that are pressed and counts clicks per second.

[jQuery slider](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Emnalyeriar/learning_projects/blob/master/jQuery%20slider/index.html) - jQuery slider I made with a tutorial, made a few tweaks and upgraded it to jQuery 1.11.
